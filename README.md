# Flipkart-Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Flipkart's customer service interactions to identify factors influencing customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores. The goal is to enhance service quality, optimize response times, and improve customer experience using data-driven insights.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Visualization** 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## Problem Statement
Flipkart operates in a highly competitive e-commerce market where excellent customer service is crucial for customer retention. However, identifying key factors affecting customer satisfaction across different service channels remains a challenge. This project analyzes service performance metrics, customer feedback, and resolution times to optimize operations and enhance customer experience.

## Business Objective
- Identify major factors affecting customer satisfaction.
- Improve response and resolution times.
- Optimize customer support channels for better efficiency.
- Enhance agent performance through data-driven training.
- Reduce complaints and increase customer loyalty.

## Data Insights & Key Findings
- **Resolution Time Impacts Satisfaction:** Faster resolutions lead to higher CSAT scores.
- **Support Channel Differences:** Live chat performs better than email and phone support.
- **Category-Specific Complaints:** Some Category has lower CSAT scores due to quality and delivery issues.
- **Agent Performance Variability:** Some agents consistently receive higher CSAT scores, while others need training.
- **Top Customer Complaints:** Late deliveries, refunds, and damaged products are common pain points.

## Solution Approach
1. **Reduce Response & Resolution Time** → Use chatbots, train agents, and allocate more staff to peak hours.
2. **Improve Support Channels** → Promote high-rated channels and enhance slow-performing ones.
3. **Enhance Product Quality & Service** → Focus on high-complaint categories and improve return processes.
4. **Train & Support Agents** → Provide additional training and recognize top performers.
5. **Analyze & Improve Feedback Handling** → Regularly track customer feedback for continuous service improvement.


## Visualizations
The project includes **15+ charts** to explore trends, relationships, and key insights, such as:
- CSAT score distribution
- Resolution time vs. satisfaction
- Complaint trends across product categories
- Agent and shift performance analysis
- Issue resolution trends over time
